## Filter and Logical Operators

(1) Find all flights that departed in November or December.

(2) Find all flights that werenâ€™t delayed on arrival by more than two hours

## Arrange and find

(1) Sort flights to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that left earliest.

(2) Which flights traveled the farthest? Which traveled the shortest?

## More on select and arrange
(1) Select dep_time, sched_dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, sched_arr_time, and arr_delay from flights and save the subset as flights_time.

(2) Arrange flights_time by dep_delay in descending order and then by arr_delay in descending order. Save this sorted data frame as flights_time2

(3) Make an one-liner code for the two steps (#1 and #2 above). Use nested function calls. Save this selected and sorted data frame as flights_time3


## Find the most delayed plane on average for arrivals

(1) Remove rows having NA in dep_delay and arr_delay (The results will be a data frame with no canceled flights.)

(2) Save the filtered data frame as not_canceled

(3) Summarise the not_canceld data frame by average arrival delay (arr_delay), grouped by plane (tailnum)

(4) Find the plane (identified by it tail number) that have the highest average arrival delay and report how long it delayed its arrivals on average.
