# Foundtations of Data Science with Capstone at SMU, Summer 2023

## Course Description

Data science is the interdisciplinary study of the tools and theory behind using data to extract knowledge. It combines ideas from statistics, computer science, and particular domains in the physical and social sciences in order to make predictions and optimal decisions.

This summer intensive course is designed with a practical approach. The students will be guided to learn the basics and move on to more advanced topics in 2 weeks. The final 1 week will be dedicated to practicing and presenting data science skills and competency through capstone projects. 

데이터 과학은 데이터를 활용하여 지식을 추출하기 위한 도구와 이론에 관한 다학제적인(interdisciplinary) 연구입니다. 이는 통계학, 컴퓨터 과학, 물리학과 사회과학의 특정 분야에서 아이디어를 결합하여 예측과 최적의 결정을 내리는 데 사용됩니다.

3주간의 여름학기 집중과정은 실용적인 접근 방식으로 설계되었습니다. 학생들은 2주 동안 기초를 학습하고 더욱 고급 주제로 나아갈 수 있도록 마지막 1주에 캡스톤 프로젝트를 하게됩니다. 이 캡스톤 프로젝트를 통해 학생들은 데이터과학에 쓰이는 기술과 역량을 실습하고 마지막에 프로젝트 발표를 하게 될 것입니다.

## Session 1: Building Foundations (2 weeks)
During the first 2 weeks, you will learn the foundations of data science including the basics of how to structure, visualize, transform, and model data. The primary programming language that we will be using is R, which is both simple to use and was designed around using data. The development environment we will be using is RStudio. Both R and RStudio are open source, and so may be downloaded to your personal laptop for free.

## Session 2: Practicing Knowledge (1 week)  
The Data Science Capstone is a team-based, project-based session, providing an opportunity to apply data science skills and knowledge obtained from the first 2 weeks of the foundation session. Teams of two or three students, under the direction of the course instructor and teaching assistants, will be working on a data project. The primary objective is to educate the students in solving real world data science problems in professional settings by leveraging their own computational, statistical, and domain skills. The capstone will end with a final presentation.

## Student Expectation and Project Outcomes of Capstone

Students will work independently as well as collaboratively in the group for at least 5 hours a day on modeling, analysis, data manipulation/wrangling, visualization, etc. as needed for the project. At the same time, students will be guided to learn soft skills such as project management, presentation, and communication through the daily sync. Students will be expected to read necessary background articles/books, learn additional tools, and log their own work and time.

Each team will provide the following outcomes in a timely manner:
•	A project proposal detailing the intended goals, methodology, and deliverables
•	A final presentation on the project outcomes
•	A GitHub page containing all outcomes (README, data, codes, analyses results, etc.)

## Textbook

We will be using R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. This book is open source and can be found/downloaded online. Korean version is also available online.
