Day8 Quiz

Any questions?


Today's Topic
============
- Working with Dates and Times
- Functions
- Conditions
- Iteration



[Hands-On] Time Zones
===========
```{r}
today()
today(tzone = "America/Los_Angeles")

# How about Korea?
today(tzone = "<FILL_IN>")
```

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones


Programming in R
================
__"Programming is Communication"__

(1) Programming is a way to communicate with computers   
(2) Programming is a way to communicate with other humans   
(3) Programming is a way to communicate with your future self   

__"Programming is Writing"__

In many ways, programming is very similar to writing. You write something to communicate. You rewrite something to make your messages more clear. You make notes on your sentences to help you remember your thoughts and intention.

Functions
=============
__Functions allow you to automate common tasks in a more powerful and general way than copy-and-pasting.__

>> When should you write a function?

How to make a function 
=================

Three key steps to creating a new function:   

1. You need to pick a name for the function.   
2. You list the inputs, or arguments, to the function inside function.   
3. You place the code you have developed in body of the function, a { block that immediately follows function(...)

```{r}
rescale01 <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
}
```

- What is the name of the function?
- What is input?
- What is function body?
- What is output?

[Hands-On] Turning into functions
============
Exercise 19.2.1: #3

```{r}
mean(is.na(x)) # Returns proportion of NAs in a vector `prop_na`

x / sum(x, na.rm = TRUE) # Standardizes a vector `sum_to_one`

sd(x, na.rm = TRUE) / mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) # calculates the coefficient of variation `coef_variation`
```

```{r}
# Test your functions with x below

x <- c(0, 1, 2, NA, 4, NA)

```

Some Tips for Creating Functions
=================

1. Use descriptive name with snake_case

2. Use a common prefix, rather than suffix
```{r}
# Good
input_select()
input_checkbox()
input_text()

# Not so good
select_input()
checkbox_input()
text_input()
```


Some Tips for Creating Functions (cont)
==========
3. Avoid overriding existing functions and variables
```{r}
mean <- function(x) {
  sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)/length(x)
} # Don't do this
```

4. Use lots of comments and break up your file into easily readable chunks.
```{r}
# Load Data ---

```

Conditional Execution (If statement)
==================

```{r}
if (condition) {
  # code executed when condition is TRUE
} else {
  # code executed when condition is FALSE
}
```

Conditions
=============
The condition must evaluate to either TRUE or FALSE (i.e., one logical value). 

```{r}
if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) {} # throws a warning for multiple logical values
 
if (NA) {} # Error!

```

Be careful about vectorized functions! So, you should never use `&` or `|` if your condition evaluates a multiple values. 
- any() (Are Some Values True?)
- all() (Are All Values True?).

Be careful about using a result of floating point calculation.

```{r}
x <- sqrt(2) ^ 2
x
x == 2
x - 2
```

Multiple conditions
=========
```{r}
if (this) {
  # do that
} else if (that) {
  # do something else
} else {
  # 
}
```

Function arguments
===================
Usually, the first argument is __data__ to compute on.

And then the __details__ of computation follows as the next arguments and should have default values. 

```{r}
# Compute confidence interval around mean using normal approximation
mean_ci <- function(x, conf = 0.95) {
  se <- sd(x) / sqrt(length(x))
  alpha <- 1 - conf
  mean(x) + se * qnorm(c(alpha / 2, 1 - alpha / 2))
}

x <- runif(100)
mean_ci(x)

mean_ci(x, conf = 0.99)

```

Checking Outputs
================

It’s good practice to check important preconditions, and throw an error (with stop()), if they are not true:

```{r}
wt_mean <- function(x, w) {
  if (length(x) != length(w)) {
    stop("`x` and `w` must be the same length", call. = FALSE)
  }
  sum(w * x) / sum(w)
}
```
 
Use `stopifnot(...)`: It throws a generic error message if each argument is __not__ TRUE.

Return values
===============
__The value returned by the function is usually the last statement it evaluates, but you can choose to return early by using return().__

Think about using explicit `return()` in a function. Ask there questions:

1. Does returning early make your function easier to read?

2. Can you make your function pipeable?

Compare the following two functions
=============

```{r}
f <- function() {
  if (x) {
    # Do 
    # something
    # that
    # takes
    # many
    # lines
    # to
    # express
  } else {
    # return something short
  }
}
```

------------

```{r}
f <- function() {
  if (!x) {
    return(something_short)
  }

  # Do 
  # something
  # that
  # takes
  # many
  # lines
  # to
  # express
}
```

Is your function pipable?
=================
```{r}
show_missings <- function(df) {
  n <- sum(is.na(df))
  cat("Missing values: ", n, "\n", sep = "")
  
  invisible(df) # not visible, but will return df
}

x <- show_missings(mtcars)
class(x)
dim(x)
head(x)
```

This makes the piping operation possible:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  show_missings() %>% 
  mutate(mpg = ifelse(mpg < 20, NA, mpg)) %>% 
  show_missings() 
```

Iteration
==============

See examples at https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#for-loops

1. Prepare output first   
2. Use sequence: `i in seq_along(df)`   
3. Body should contain proper indexing

```{r}
output <- vector("double", ncol(df))  # 1. output
for (i in seq_along(df)) {            # 2. sequence
  output[[i]] <- median(df[[i]])      # 3. body
}
```
