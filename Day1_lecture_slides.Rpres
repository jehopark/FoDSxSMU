Introduction to Data Science
========================================================
__Today's Goals__

(1) Make sure everyone set the RStudio environment    
(2) Get familiar with RStudio environment  
(3) Create a first R markdown file  
(4) Learn basic visualization methods and grammars of graphics using ggplot2 package   
(If time permits, solve exercise problems and add solutions to a markdown)

What is Data Science?  
=============
## 데이터 과학이란 무엇인가?


데이터 과학은 데이터를 이해하고 활용하기 위해 수학, 통계학, 컴퓨터 과학 등의 다양한 학문과 기술을 결합하는 학문 분야입니다. 

데이터 과학은 데이터를 수집, 정제, 분석하고 모델링하여 통찰력을 얻고 예측이나 패턴 인식을 통해 데이터를 근거로 한 의사 결정을 위해 데이터를 활용하는데 중점을 둡니다. 

데이터 과학은 실제 상황에서 문제를 해결하고 효과적인 의사 결정을 내리기 위해 데이터를 탐색하고 인사이트를 도출하는 모든 프로세스를 포함합니다.

[Breakout Session 1] Open Discussion
=================
- Team up!

- Discuss briefly about what the informed decisions might be in your domain/field (5 min)

- Share your team's example(s) in the main room (5 min)

R and RStudio
=============
<div align="center">

</div>

What is R?
========================================================
* R is a statistical programming language and environment.
* R is open source/free.
* R is widely used.
* R is cross-platform.
* R is hard to learn (?)

What is not R?
========================================================
* S: R's ancestor
* S-Plus: Commercial; modern implementation of S
* SAS: Commercial; widely used in the commercial analytics.
* SPSS: Commercial; easy to use; widely used in Social Science.
* MATLAB: Commercial; can do some Stats. 
* Python: Also can do some Stats; good in deep learning

Whic is better for Data Science? R or Python?
=============
R is Useful and easier to do __Statistical Modeling and Visualization__

---------

Python has a great collection of libraries to do __Machine learning and Deep Learning__

R Packages
========================================================
- R is known for its community and its huge collection of user-generated packages
- Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format. The directory where packages are stored is called the library.
- We will install the `tidyverse` package, a collection of R packages for data science

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tidyverse') # you can also use RStudio's Packages tab

# You should load dplyr package first to use any functions and datasets in the package
library(tidyverse) 
```

What is RStudio?
========================================================
* Integrated Development Environment for R
* Nice combination of GUI and CLI
* Free and commercial version
* 4 main windows, tabs, etc
* Version control: Git and VPN
* Debugging 
* Documentation: R Markdown
  - install.packages("rmarkdown")
  - http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/
* Presentation slides: R Presentation (this one!)


How to Get Help
========================================================
* ChatGPT
* Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r
* Cross-Validated: the statistics Q&A site http://stats.stackexchange.com/
* Google


[Hands-On] Check Your R Environment

- Check RStudio (if you don't have RStudio, install it now)

- Share your screen

[Hands-On] First R Project 
========================

- Create a new project named "FoDSxSMU"

   - Click on New Project button
   - Choose New Project from Git Repository
   - Paste the following URL: https://github.com/jehopark/FoDSxSMU.git
   

Documentation: R Markdown 
========================
__R Markdown is our main documentation tool__

- Basic Formatting

  - Code chunk options
- R Markdown cheat sheet and quick reference
  - https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-15.HTML

R Markdown Basic Formatting
======================

Open "Basic_formatting.Rmd"


[Hands-On] First R Markdown 
========================
__R Markdown__  

1. Create a new R Markdown (Rmd) file named "FoDSxSMU_Day1"
1. Check if you have knitr package (if not, install it)
1. Check R Markdown Cheatsheet
1. Check this website
https://ntaback.github.io/UofT_STA130/Rmarkdownforclassreports.html#what_is_markdown

[Hands-On] First R Markdown (cont.)
========================
__R Markdown__ 

Let's go over __Section 27.3__ Text Formatting.

- Copy and paste Section 27.3 code snippet into your Rmd file


[Hands-On Exercise 1] R Markdown Exercise 
=================

1. Add your name in the header section

1. Do 27.3.1 #2 exercise

1. By the end of today's lab session, upload your Rmd file at Canvas 과제제출 페이지 (Hands-On Exercise #1 R Markdown)


Session 2
===========================
# Visualization


Visualization with ggplot2: tidyverse package
======================
* Load tidyverse package in your environment
```{r}
# if you don't have the package installed yet
# install.package("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```
>> This should load several packages. See the R message on the console. Notice the "Conflicts" -- what does this mean?

mpg dataset
==================
```{r}
?mpg
```

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/mpg.png" width=800>
</div>



Visualization with ggplot2: a quick look
======================
```{r}
# library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

```{r}
# Compare ggplot() with plot() from base package
base::plot(mpg$displ, mpg$hwy)
```

>> Let's look at a grammar of graphics


Visualization with ggplot2: A Grammar of Graphics
=======================

>> A grammar of graphics is a set of tools for building graphics by adding components and transformations __layer by layer__.  

--

>> Every ggplot2 plot has three key components:
>> - __Data__,
>> - A set of __aesthetic mappings__ between variables in the data and visual properties, and
>> - At least one __layer__ which describes how to render each observation. Layers are usually created with a `geom` function.



Visualization with ggplot2: A Grammar of Graphics (cont.)
=======================
>> Every ggplot2 plot has three key components: data, aesthetic mappings, geometric object

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # load ggplot2 package
ggplot(data = mpg) + # data
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) # geometric object and aesthetic mapping
```

Template
======

```
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```
